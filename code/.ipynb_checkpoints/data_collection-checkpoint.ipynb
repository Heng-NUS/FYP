Yn Cadwch Gymru’n Daclus, rydym yn angerddol am gefnogi ac ysbrydoli pobl ifanc i weithredu i ddiogelu a gofalu am eu hamgylchedd lleol, gan greu Cymru fwy diogel, lanach, iachach a mwy cynaliadwy.

Rhwng 2008 a 2018, fe wnaethom gefnogi dros 3,000 o grwpiau cymunedol a gweithio gyda 30,000 o wirfoddolwyr ysbrydoledig ar gyfartaledd bob blwyddyn. Gyda’n gilydd, cynhaliwyd 83,000 o ymgyrchoedd glanhau. Wrth gwrs, ni fyddem wedi gallu gwneud gwahaniaeth cadarnhaol i Gymru heb gymorth pobl eraill.
