out of 956 #coronavirus cases reported in #hubei 338 are critical, that's 35%. China has NO handle on mortality rate bc they're not testing everyone, alive or dead. Current *official* mortality is 2% but if 35% are critical, don'tcha think mortality rate is closer to that?
So many unknowns about #coronavirus because of China‚Äôs secrecy. Are the dead still infectious? And for how long? China is cremating bodies. Why are people falling lifeless going about their daily business? Why is the disease being treated like radiation, req full hazmat suits?

#Wuhan #Coronavirus Outbreak Shows The Importance Of Sound Science, Sleuthing, And Cooperation - by @DrJudyStone  A new virus is emerging in China. Its investigation has been handled more openly than before.  https://t.co/Gs0DNOn3jY #WuhanPneumonia https://t.co/VHDTvs4N2E
The World Health Organisation (@WHO) announced on the 12th that it has received #China's new #coronavirus gene sequence information from unexplained viral #pneumonia cases in #Wuhan, #China. The WHO also said that it does not recommend any travel or trade restriction on #China.
It‚Äôs not known whether a #SARS-like ‚Äú#coronavirus‚Äù has been identified, although there have been ‚Äúnumerous unsubstantiated reports mentioning a novel coronavirus that is SARS-like,‚Äù the @ISID_org ProMED said Friday. @thecolumbian https://t.co/XxGL3sd9za

Interesting review of what we know (or don't know) about the #pneumonia cases in #Wuhan province. It's neither a  human or avian strain of #influenza nor #Adenovirus. So good chance it's a #Coronavirus. https://t.co/g53SibFBlZ

5th Jan Wuhan official report  1. 59 cases, 7 of them are severe, no ones are killed by the pneumonia.  2. SARS and MERS are now ruled out, not yet for novel #coronavirus.  3. No obvious #h2h evidence. https://t.co/ZNGf8LICSh
If the causative pathogen of the pneumonia cases in Wuhan turns out to be a new type of #coronavirus, you don‚Äôt need to be so surprised. https://t.co/xgA18SU83D
The new #SARS @ #Wuhan in #CCPChina is caused by a new #coronavirus. #CCPChina is relaxing its rules to allow #Chinese to travel abroad. It is like launching a "live biological warfare" globally. https://t.co/y0yq6boMzI
