The general aim of this project is analyzing social media data to surveil healthcare condition. It can be detailed as follow:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Healthcare-related textual information should be correctly recognized and extracted.
    \item Robust topic model is required for accurate grouping and naming healthcare events.
\end{enumerate}

The key objectives of this project are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Collecting data of a certain social media platform. This data can be either extracted from an existing data set or crawled from that platform. If existing data set canâ€™t meet my requirement, my own data set will be made.
    \item Filtering data. In this process, a filtering rule should be established, possible solutions include using related verbal list, using NLP to classify raw data
    \item Designing and training a supervised model that can successfully classify whether a document is healthcare-related or not.
    \item Designing an unsupervised topic model that can generate interpretable topics.
    \item Result visualization. The final result should be instructive and easy to read. Therefore, some uninterpretable topics should be excluded (based on coherence) and the remaining should be visualized.
\end{enumerate}
