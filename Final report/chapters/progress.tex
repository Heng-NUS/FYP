This chapter covers the progress made so far and the remaining tasks needed to be done.
\section{Project management}
This section records the progress of this project so far, starting from Oct 20, 2019. Following is the progress list ranked by chronological order:\\
Autumn semester (weekly):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Oct 27, 2019: Searched and read 13 papers related to our project, having a basic idea in mind. Wrote some sketch of functions that will be used in our implementation.
    \item Nov 03, 2019: Searched and downloaded alternative twitter dataset. Implemented functions that can batch process the downloaded files (unzip the whole directory recursively). Built a preliminary exclusion dictionary used to filter out irrelevant tweets. Implemented functions that can batch filter the unzipped twitter json files. Prepared and past the Gre exam. 
    \item Nov 10, 2019: Searched and collected CDC dataset. Implemented functions that can process the CDC file. Wrote interim report (Data collection section). Searched and read papers related to filtering tweets. Finished coursework 1 of Computer Graphics.
    \item Nov 17, 2019: Wrote interim report (Data collection and Design section), Implemented functions used to regularize our dataset. Set filtering rules, implemented functions used to label our dataset, and manully labeled 1000 tweets.
    \item Nov 24, 2019: Found the filtered dataset contains few samples, and can hardly be used to analyze. Therefore, the topic was changed slightly based on the dataset itself. Wrote interim report of Computer Graphics project.
    \item Dec 01, 2019: Finished coursework2 of Computer Graphics, implemented functions for Computer Graphics project.
    \item Dec 08, 2019: Finished coursework2 of Computing Ethics, built 3D scene for Computer Graphics project.
    \item Dec 15, 2019: Finished the Computer Graphics project.
\end{itemize} 
Spring semester: due to Covid-19, the progresses were recorded monthly
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dec 2019: Rewrote the implementation, fixed some bugs and added more functions for preprocessing
    \item Jan 2019: Spring festival
    \item Feb 2019: Change the project design, start to do research on topic model, found more healthcare related dataset.
    \item Mar 2019: Finished the training of supervised model, experimented with some topic modeling algorithms. Wrote sections about this part.
    \item Apr 2019: designed and implemented our own model and did experiments on it.
\end{itemize}
